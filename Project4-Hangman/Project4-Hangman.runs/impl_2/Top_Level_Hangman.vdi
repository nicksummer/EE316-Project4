WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 INST_LCD/seq_cntr_reg_rep has an input control pin INST_LCD/seq_cntr_reg_rep/ENARDEN (net: INST_LCD/inst_i2cm_n_31) which is driven by a register (INST_LCD/inst_i2cm/busy_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
